## Introduction

The Conversation Tree Editor is a powerful tool that allows you to design and visualize conversation flows in a user-friendly, visual interface. Whether you're creating customer surveys, support dialogues, or interactive voice responses, this editor helps you craft natural and personalized conversations.

## Getting Started

### Main Interface Overview

When you open the Conversation Tree Editor, you'll see the main workspace divided into several key areas:

- **Top Bar**: Contains navigation buttons, settings, the auto-generate feature, and save options.
- **Sidebar**: Offers various node subtypes to add to your conversation flow.
- **Canvas**: The central area where you'll build and visualize your conversation tree.
- **Variable Management Panel**: Accessed via the sidebar, it allows you to manage variables used in your flow.

### Creating a New Conversation Flow

1. **Start a New Flow**: Click on the **"New Flow"** button or select an existing template.
2. **Name Your Flow**: Give your conversation flow a descriptive name to easily identify it later.
3. **Save Your Work**: Regularly click the **"Save"** button in the top bar to save your progress.

## Building Your Conversation Flow

### Adding Nodes

Nodes are the building blocks of your conversation flow. Each node represents a point in the conversation where the agent interacts with the customer. The sidebar contains the node subtypes, which are:

- **QA Nodes**: For asking questions and receiving answers.
- **Action Nodes**: For performing actions like sending emails, SMS messages, booking appointments, or transferring calls.
- **End Nodes**: For ending the conversation gracefully.

#### Question & Answer (QA) Nodes

- **Purpose**: To ask questions and collect responses from the user.
- **How to Add**:
  - Click on the **QA Node** icon (chat bubble) in the sidebar.
  - Drag and drop it onto the canvas.
- **Usage**: Ideal for greetings, collecting user information, and any interaction requiring user input.

#### Action Nodes

- **Purpose**: To perform specific actions based on user responses.
- **Available Action Nodes**:
  - **Email Node**: Sends an automated email to the user.
  - **SMS Node**: Sends a text message in real-time during the conversation.
  - **Booking Node**: Schedules appointments or reservations.
  - **Taking Message Node**: Records and stores messages from the user.
  - **Transfer Call Node**: Transfers the call to a live agent (this action ends the conversation with the agent).
  - **API Node**: Integrates with external systems via API calls.
- **How to Add**:
  - Select the appropriate Action Node icon from the sidebar.
  - Drag and drop it onto the canvas.
- **Usage**:
  - Use action nodes at various stages in the conversation to perform tasks like sending information or booking appointments.
  - **Note**: The **Transfer Call** action will end the conversation with the agent, so it should be used when you intend to transfer the call to a human representative.

#### End Call Nodes

- **Purpose**: To gracefully end the conversation.
- **How to Add**:
  - Click on the **End Node** icon in the sidebar.
  - Place it at the point where the conversation should conclude.
- **Usage**: Always ensure your flow ends with an End Call node to signal the conversation's closure.

### Configuring Nodes

After adding nodes, you'll need to configure them to define their behavior and content.

#### Writing Agent Scripts

- **Script Field**: Each node has a script field where you write what the agent will say.
- **Tips**:
  - Use a friendly and professional tone.
  - Keep messages clear and concise.
  - Personalize messages using variables (e.g., "Hello {customerName}").

#### Storing User Responses

- **Variables**: Collect and store user responses in variables for later use.
- **How to Assign**:
  - In the node configuration, find the **"Store In Variable"** section.
  - Select an existing variable or create a new one.
- **Usage**: Variables can be used to personalize scripts, set conditions for transitions, and be included in actions like emails or SMS messages.

#### Using Variables in Actions

- **Incorporating Variables**: When configuring action nodes, you can use variables to personalize the content.
- **Example in SMS Node**:
  - **Message Content**: "Hello {customerName}, here is the link you requested: {linkURL}"
  - Use the **"+"** button next to the text box to add variables.
- **Available in All Actions**: Variables can be used in Email, SMS, Booking, API calls, etc.

#### Setting Up Transitions

Transitions define how the conversation moves from one node to the next based on user responses or conditions.

##### Adding Transitions

1. **From a Node**: Click on the node from which you want to create a transition.
2. **Drag Transition Line**: Click and drag from the transition point (often a small circle or arrow) to the target node.
3. **Label the Transition**: Give the transition a clear and descriptive label that reflects the condition or response (e.g., "Yes", "No", "Email Provided").

##### Editing Transitions

- **Adjusting Connections**:
  - To change a transition, click on the transition line and drag it to a different node.
- **Deleting Transitions**:
  - Click on the transition line and press the delete key, or use the delete icon in the node's transition settings.
- **Adding Conditions**:
  - In the node's configuration panel, you can add new transitions by clicking the **"+"** button.

##### Conditional Transitions

- **Purpose**: To define different paths based on specific conditions or user inputs.
- **How to Enable**:
  - In the node configuration, toggle **"Conditional Transitions"** on.
- **Setting Conditions**:
  - Define conditions based on variables (e.g., if `satisfactionLevel` is greater than 4).
  - Label each conditional path clearly.
- **Benefits**:
  - Allows for dynamic and personalized conversation flows.
  - Ensures users receive relevant responses and actions based on their input.

**Example**:

- **Question**: "Would you like to receive updates via email?"
- **Transitions**:
  - **Yes**: Connects to the node where the email is collected.
  - **No**: Connects to the next appropriate node or ends the conversation.

## Using the Sidebar Tools

The sidebar provides quick access to various node subtypes and tools to enhance your conversation flow:

- **QA Nodes**: Use these to ask questions and receive user input.
- **Action Nodes**:
  - **Email Node**: Send automated emails.
  - **SMS Node**: Send text messages in real-time.
  - **Booking Node**: Schedule appointments or reservations.
