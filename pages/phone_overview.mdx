In order to initiate inbound or outbound call activities on NLPearl.AI, you need to have phone numbers linked to your account. These phone numbers determine the country code for your campaigns and activities, making them essential for ensuring proper communication with leads or customers based on their location.

Whether you’re running a sales campaign or handling customer support, phone numbers allow you to tailor your activities to specific regions. The phone number’s country code plays a crucial role, especially for compliance and regional availability.
