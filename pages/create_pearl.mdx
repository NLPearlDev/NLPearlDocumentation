First, it’s important to understand that the process of creating your phone agent is divided into two parts: the first part involves creating and customizing your Pearl for personalized conversational flows within NLPearl.AI, and the second focuses on setting up your inbound or outbound campaign that will use your Pearl.

<Info>
### What is a Pearl?

Creating a Pearl is similar to hiring a new employee. You choose its language, character, and provide a script that explains how it should interact with customers, guiding its actions, knowledge, and responses.

## Step-by-Step Guide to Creating a Simple Pearl

<Steps>

<Step title="Select “Simple” Mode and Define the Pearl’s Use Case">

When you first land on the platform, you’ll have the option to select a **use case** to start configuring your Pearl. If you skip this step, you can still create a Pearl at any time by navigating to the **Phone Pearls** page and clicking the **Create** button.

<Note>
To create a **Simple Pearl**, make sure to select the **Simple** tab at the top of the page before proceeding.
</Note>

Choose the type of Pearl that fits your use case below.

| Model | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `PersonalSecretary` | A reliable assistant for sending messages, scheduling appointments, and delivering knowledge-based responses — minus the coffee runs. |
| `Support` | Efficient for handling customer service, managing issues, sending emails, or creating tickets. Handles any action smoothly. |
| `Sales` | Fast and engaging, ideal for proactive conversations, lead qualification, and seamless sales-related tasks. |
| `Surveys` | Great for collecting feedback. Lightweight and easy to interrupt while remaining effective in any context. |
| `Concierge` | Tailored for hospitality. Can handle bookings, provide recommendations, and perform various service-oriented actions. |
| `Conversationalist` | A fully open conversational model. Great for exploring ideas, casual discussions, or anything that requires nuance — even bold topics. |

</Step>

<Step title="Set a Name and Icon for Your Pearl">

Before diving into the setup of your agent’s features and behaviors, begin by giving your Pearl a name and a face. This simple step helps make your agent feel more personal and easier to identify as you build it out.

Start by assigning a clear, **friendly name to your Pearl**. It should be easy to recognize at a glance — especially if you plan to create multiple Pearls later. A good name helps you keep things organized and find the right agent quickly.

Then, choose an **icon from the avatar gallery** to visually represent your Pearl. This visual identity gives your agent a face and helps you spot it instantly, even in a long list of Pearls.

</Step>

<Step title="Agent Customization">
In this step, you can customize your voice agent’s identity and behavior by setting its **name**, **language**, **voice**, **personality**, and **timezone**.

<Card>

**Agent Names, Languages & Voices**

To define your agent’s identity:

- **<span style={{ color: '#f87171', fontWeight: 600 }}>(1)</span> Agent Name** – Give your agent a name (e.g., *Joa*, *Victoria*). This name helps humanize the interaction and reflect your brand identity.
- **<span style={{ color: '#f87171', fontWeight: 600 }}>(2)</span> Language** – Select the default language your agent will speak. This ensures accurate pronunciation and localized expressions.
- **<span style={{ color: '#f87171', fontWeight: 600 }}>(3)</span> Voice** – Choose the voice that will represent your agent. You can preview voices and select the one that fits your tone.

        className="rounded-[14px]"
      />
    </div>
  </Frame>
</div>

---

**Multilingual Agent Configuration:**

You can set up your Pearl to support multiple languages by creating several agent configurations — each with a specific **name**, **language**, and **voice**.

- To add a new language configuration, click on the **"+"** button <span style={{ color: '#f87171', fontWeight: 600 }}>(2)</span>. This allows you to define additional agents who can handle conversations in other languages.
- Each configuration should include a **name** (used during calls), a **language**, and a corresponding **voice**.

When a caller requests to switch to another language during the conversation, Pearl will automatically reroute the call to the agent associated with that language — ensuring a smooth and localized experience.

- The **first agent** you create is automatically marked as the **Default Agent** <span style={{ color: '#f87171', fontWeight: 600 }}>(1)</span>. This agent will always initiate the conversation when a call begins, unless another language is requested by the caller.

<Note>
You can define as many language configurations as needed — perfect for global audiences or multilingual teams.

<Step title="Agent Knowledge Base">

Before your Pearl can answer questions accurately, it needs context. This step helps define the essential background information your agent will rely on during conversations.

<Card>

**Company Name**

Give your Pearl the name of the company it represents. This name may be used when Pearl introduces itself or provides company-related information.

**Pearl Knowledge Base**

This is where you teach Pearl what it needs to know to respond with relevance and accuracy. Add detailed information about your services, pricing, opening hours, locations, and any key operational data.

<Note>
You can either write this content manually or upload a reference file.  
Multiple documents can be added if needed — supported formats: `.doc`, `.docx`, `.txt`.
</Note>

Whether you're describing how your subscription plans work, listing available services, or clarifying your business hours, this section allows Pearl to access structured information that supports more precise answers.

**Memory**

When enabled, Pearl remembers the user or lead, allowing it to seamlessly continue conversations from where they left off.

<Tip>
This feature is particularly useful for:
- Multi-step processes  
- Follow-ups  
- Any scenario where continuity matters
</Tip>

<Card>
### Example use case: Hospitality

Let’s say a guest checks into a hotel. Pearl can:
- Remember their room number  
- Greet them by name  
- Recall their preferences (like “extra towels” or “no wake-up call”)  
- Offer a smooth, personalized experience every time they call
</Card>

<Info>
**Resetting Memory**

Need a fresh start? Pearl’s memory can be reset via API.

This is especially important in contexts like hospitality, where once a guest checks out, Pearl clears the slate — ensuring the next visitor starts with a clean experience.

**Speech Recognition Keywords**

Some words are just… not in the dictionary. Whether you’re using brand-specific terms, creative product names, or industry jargon, teaching Pearl how to recognize them makes all the difference.

Use this feature to define:
- **Keywords**: The unique word or name you want Pearl to catch
- **Pronunciations**: Variations of how users might say it (spoken form)

<Card>
### Example

Let’s say your bakery sells a pastry called `FluffoBun`.

Here’s how you’d define it:
- **Keyword:** FluffoBun  
- **Pronunciations:** fluh-foh-bun, floof-oh-bun, fluff-bunb  
*(Separate each pronunciation with a comma)*

This helps Pearl match even creatively named terms to real user input — no matter how it’s pronounced.

</Step>

<Step title="Flow Configuration">
Design how Pearl interacts with callers, from the very first sentence to the full script and in-call actions. This step allows you to craft a smooth, human-like call experience.

<Card>

**Opening Sentence**

Set the first sentence Pearl will say when answering a call. This is your agent’s opening line — keep it simple, clear, and aligned with your brand.


<Warning>

- **Using variables**:  
  You can include dynamic variables like `{{company name}}` or `{{agent name}}` in your sentence. <br/>  
  However, avoid using lead-specific variables — they won’t be available during inbound calls.


- **Multilingual setup**:  
  The sentence is spoken exactly as written in the default language. <br/> 
  For example, if your default language is Spanish, the sentence must also be in Spanish.  <br/> <br/> 
  If you later change the default language, don’t forget to update your sentence accordingly.

**Flow Script**

The flow script defines how Pearl will handle a conversation from start to finish — much like what you'd give a human agent. It guides the dialogue, handles objections, answers key questions, and helps your caller reach the right outcome.

To make it dynamic and personalized, we strongly recommend using [Variables](/pages/variables).

<Note>
The flow script is not required for the **Personal Secretary** use case. In that scenario, Pearl operates without a predefined script.

Just describe your use case (e.g. “I want Pearl to handle delivery issues and send tracking links”), and it’ll generate a ready-to-edit flow tailored to that context.

**Define the Success of Your Pearl**

Specify what constitutes a successful call for your Pearl — such as booking a meeting, confirming interest, or qualifying a lead. This success definition will be reflected in your campaign analytics and lead statuses, helping you sort and follow up efficiently.

<Info>
If you don’t define success for your Pearl, all answered calls will be marked as **Completed** by default.  <br/><br/>
By using this feature, you’ll unlock two possible outcomes instead: **Call Successful** and **Call Unsuccessful**, giving you more control over lead qualification.

**Indicator Tags**

Use **Indicator Tags** to label and categorize key moments in a conversation.  <br/><br/>
They help you structure your data, identify important insights, and filter your leads with precision.

Each tag includes:

- **Name** — A clear label (e.g. `"Interested"`, `"Mentioned Competitor"`)
- **Color** — Used for visual sorting in your interface
- **Assignment rule** — A short description of when the tag should be applied

Tags are assigned automatically during the call, based on the conditions you define.

<Card>
### Example

You're asking leads what they usually drink in the morning. You might define:

- **Tag**: `Coffee`  
  - **Color**: Brown  
  - **When to assign**: If the lead mentions drinking coffee

- **Tag**: `Tea`  
  - **Color**: Green  
  - **When to assign**: If the lead mentions drinking tea

These tags will then appear in your lead data and call logs, making it easy to segment and analyze responses.
</Card>

<Info>
Indicator Tags are not just for display — they’re functional. You can filter campaigns by tag, trigger notifications, or use them to define success in analytics.

**Notifications**

Notifications allow you to receive updates about Pearl’s calls through the channel of your choice.  

You can be alerted when specific conditions are met — ensuring you focus only on what matters most.

**Configuration Options**

| Channel      | Description |
|--------------|-------------|
| **Email**    | Enter one or more email addresses to receive call summaries. Make sure each address is valid to ensure proper delivery. |
| **Slack**    | Connect your Slack workspace and select the channel where notifications should be posted. This is done via OAuth integration. |
| **API**      | Define a webhook URL where Pearl will POST call notification data in real time. Useful for CRM or custom workflow integrations. |

**When to Trigger Notifications**

| Trigger Type          | Description |
|-----------------------|-------------|
| **Always**            | Get notified after **every call**, regardless of outcome. |
| **Based on Tags**     | Notify only when specific **Indicator Tags** are assigned. |
| **Based on Success**  | Notify when the call is marked as **Successful** or **Unsuccessful**, based on your **Define Success** setup. |
| **Based on Actions**  | Notify when specific **Actions** are triggered during the call — such as booking a meeting, sending an email or SMS, or transferring the call. |


<Info>
Notifications and Indicator Tags are closely connected. Tags act as filters for when a notification should be triggered.  

For example, you might define a tag like `"High Priority"` or `"Follow-up Needed"` — and configure notifications to trigger only when those tags are present.  

This ensures you’re alerted only for meaningful, action-worthy calls.
</Info>


<Card title="Example: Getting notified for urgent calls only">
1. **Create a Tag**: `Urgent`  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Condition: Applied when a customer reports a critical issue.

2. **Configure Notifications**:  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Enable notifications only for calls tagged as `Urgent`.

3. **Result**:  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You receive real-time alerts only for critical calls that need immediate attention.
</Card>

<Note>
**Available Variables for End Call Notifications**

When configuring your notification messages (email, Slack, or API), a dedicated set of **end-of-call variables** is available — including call duration, summary, recording...

<Tip>
### Best Practices for Pearl Creation

When creating your Pearl, consider the following best practices to ensure optimal performance and customer satisfaction:

- **Use Variables Wisely**: Add the first name and last name variables into the opening sentence only for outbound calls when you are sure that the lead list contains this information.
- **Cultural Alignment**: Ensure the chosen language and conversational style align with the cultural expectations of your audience.
- **Feedback Incorporation**: Continuously refine your Pearl based on feedback and interaction outcomes to improve conversational effectiveness.
</Tip>
