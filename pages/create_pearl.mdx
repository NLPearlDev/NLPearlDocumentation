title: Simple Pearl
description: 'First it is important to understand that the process of creating your phone agent is divided into two parts: the first part involves creating and customizing your Pearl for personalized conversational flows in NLPearl.AI, and the second part focuses on setting up your inbound or outbound campaign that will utilize your Pearl. Let’s start by explaining and detail the first part of this process.'

### What is a Pearl?

Creating a Pearl is similar to hiring a new employee. You choose its language, character, and provide a script that explains how it should interact with customers, guiding its actions, knowledge, and responses.

### Step-by-Step Guide to Creating a Pearl

#### Step 1: Select Use Case

Choose the type of use case for your Pearl:

1. **Personal Secretary**: Your reliable assistant for managing tasks like sending messages, scheduling appointments, and providing knowledge-based information—minus the coffee runs.
2. **Sales**: A supportive model for efficient customer service, handling issues, emails, and ticket creation, capable of performing any type of action.
3. **Support**: Quick and engaging, driving proactive interactions and performing any type of action seamlessly.
4. **Surveys**: A straightforward, poll-friendly model, easy to interrupt and efficient for gathering feedback while performing any type of action.
5. **Concierge**: Trained for hospitality, managing everything from bookings to personalized recommendations and capable of any type of action.

#### Step 2: Agent Customization

1. **Agent Names, Languages & Voices**:

		style={{ 
		borderRadius: '18px', 
		}}
	/>
   - **Add Multilingual Agents**: If you want your Pearl to speak more than one language, click on the **"+"** button to add additional agent configurations.
	If during the conversation the caller requests to switch to another language, and you've added that language to your agent configurations, Pearl will smoothly inform the caller that they will be transferred to a representative who speaks that language. 
	The conversation will then continue with the agent configured for the requested language.
	Assign a name to each agent configuration. This name will be used during phone conversations in the corresponding language.
	Explore  [Voice and Language](/pages/languages) to view all the language options available.



   - **Default Agent Configuration**: The first agent configuration you add is set as the default. This agent will initiate the conversation when a call begins.

3. **Personality**: Your Pearl’s personality isn’t just for show—it determines the words and tone it uses in conversations.
Want a funny character? Get ready for the occasional joke (don’t worry, Pearl won’t quit its day job for stand-up).
Prefer an aggressive closer? Pearl will make sure “no” is just a speed bump on the way to “yes.”
Choose wisely—your AI’s personality shapes every interaction.
4. **Timezone**: Define the timezone of the agent. This influences time-related actions, such as booking meetings.

#### Step 3: Agent Knowledge Base

1. **Company Name**: Enter the name of the company the agent represents during conversations.
2. **Company Description**: Provide a brief description of the company, including sector and basic information.
3. **Pearl Knowledge Base**: Provide detailed information about your services, pricing, location, operational data, and website. This can be entered as free text or by uploading a file.
4. **Memory**: When enabled, Pearl remembers the lead or user, allowing it to pick up conversations right where they left off. This is especially useful for multi-step processes, follow-ups, or any scenario requiring continuity.
Let’s take an example from the hospitality industry—though this feature is a game-changer across all industries.
Imagine Pearl remembering guests by their room number. It can greet them by name, recall their preferences, and create a seamless, personalized experience. That’s next-level customer engagement!
Need a fresh start? No problem! You can reset Pearl’s memory via API—crucial in hospitality settings. When a guest checks out, Pearl wipes the slate clean, ensuring that the next visitor starts with a brand-new experience.
5. **Speech Recognition Keywords**
Defining your keywords helps Pearl accurately recognize terms specific to your business—especially when dealing with made-up product names or words that aren’t in the dictionary.
For example, if your bakery sells a revolutionary new pastry called FluffoBun, you can teach Pearl its possible pronunciations:<br />
<br />__• Keyword:__ FluffoBun
<br />__• Pronunciations:__ fluh-foh-bun, floof-oh-bun, fluff-bunb (*separate each pronunciation with a comma*)
<br /><br />This ensures Pearl understands your unique terminology, no matter how creatively named!

	src="/images/dark_mode/speech_reco.png"
	alt="NLPearl.AI Logo Dark"
	style={{ borderRadius: '18px' }}
	/>

#### Step 4: Flow Configuration

1. **Opening Sentence**: Define the first sentence Pearl will say when answering the phone. You can include variables like "company name" or "agent name." Avoid using lead-specific variables for inbound calls.
2. **Flow Script**: For use cases other than Personal Secretary, provide the script that Pearl will follow during conversations, similar to a script given to a human salesperson. It's very important to understand how to use [Variables](/pages/variables) to enhance the conversation experience and give Pearl better capabilities to handle the interaction.
3. **Call Actions**: Specify actions that Pearl can perform during the call, such as booking meetings, transferring calls, or sending emails and SMS messages.

For more details on actions, refer to the [Actions](/pages/action) page.

#### Step 5: Pearl Name

1. **Name of the Pearl**: Assign a friendly name to your Pearl for easy retrieval.
2. **Choose Your Pearl**: Select a logo for your Pearl from a list of available options.
3. **Define the Success of Your Pearl**: Specify what constitutes a successful call for your Pearl, such as booking a meeting, obtaining client interest, or qualifying a lead. <br />
This defined success will be reflected in the status of your leads list when you launch a campaign,  allowing you to effectively sort and manage your leads.
4. **Indicator Tags**:
	<img
	className="block dark:hidden"
	src="/images/exemples/indicatorTags.png"
	alt="API Call Setup"
	style={{ 
	borderRadius: '18px', 
	}}
	/>
	<img
		className="hidden dark:block"
		src="/images/exemples/indicatorTags.png"
		alt="API Call Setup"
		style={{ 
		borderRadius: '18px', 
		}}
	/>
   - **Purpose of Indicator Tags**: Indicator tags allow you to label your conversations based on specific criteria or events that occur during the interaction. This helps in categorizing and analyzing conversations later.

   - **How to Add Indicator Tags**:
     - **Add a Tag**: Click on the option to add a new indicator tag.
     - **Color**: Choose a color for the tag to make it easily identifiable.
     - **Name**: Provide a name for the tag.
     - **Description (When to Assign)**: Describe the condition or event when the tag should be assigned during the conversation.

   - **Example Use Case**:
     - If you're conducting a poll to find out what people prefer to drink in the morning:
       - **Tag "Coffee"**:
         - **Color**: Brown
         - **Name**: Coffee
         - **When to Assign**: "If the prospect prefers to drink coffee in the morning."
       - **Tag "Tea"**:
         - **Color**: Green
         - **Name**: Tea
         - **When to Assign**: "If the prospect prefers to drink tea in the morning."
     - During the conversation, if the prospect expresses a preference for coffee or tea, the corresponding tag will be assigned, allowing you to easily filter and analyze these interactions later.
5. **Notifications**

	The **Notifications** feature allows you to receive email summaries of calls based on specific criteria. This ensures you only get updates for the most relevant interactions.

	- Configuration Options:
	1. **Emails**:
	- Enter one or more email addresses where notifications should be sent. Make sure the email format is valid to ensure proper delivery.

	2. **Notify If**:
	- Choose the criteria for triggering notifications:
		- **Always**: Get notified for every call made by Pearl.
		- **Based on Tags**: Receive notifications only when a call matches specific **Indicator Tags**.


	-Connection with Indicator Tags

	Indicator Tags are closely linked to Notifications, enabling you to tailor your alerts:
	- **Tag-based Filtering**: Define tags to categorize calls (e.g., "High Priority," "Follow-up Needed"). Notifications can then be filtered to only include calls with these tags.
	- This connection ensures you focus on the calls that matter most.


	- Example Use Case:
		1. Create an **Indicator Tag**: "Urgent".
		- Condition: Applied when a customer reports a critical issue.
		2. Set up **Notifications**:
		- Enable notifications only for calls tagged as "Urgent".
		3. Result:
		- You receive email alerts exclusively for calls requiring immediate attention.


	This combination of **Notifications** and **Indicator Tags** helps you manage call summaries effectively and ensures you only receive relevant alerts.

- **Cultural Alignment**: Ensure the chosen language and conversational style align with the cultural expectations of your audience.
- **Feedback Incorporation**: Continuously refine your Pearl based on feedback and interaction outcomes to improve conversational effectiveness.

## Summary

Creating a Pearl is integral to deploying effective AI-driven interactions in NLPearl.AI. By carefully configuring each component of your Pearl, you ensure that your AI agents deliver not only consistent and personalized customer service but also drive meaningful engagements that can enhance overall business performance.
