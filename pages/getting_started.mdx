### Credits and Minutes Usage

Each minute of your calls will be deducted from the minutes included in your plan. Once the minutes are exhausted, your credits are being used.
Credits can also be used to purchase additional agents or phone numbers if you have sufficient balance.

#### Auto-Recharge

To ensure uninterrupted service, we recommend activating the auto-recharge feature, in order to add credit to your account. You can find it in the
[Billing Section](https://platform.nlpearl.ai/app/settings/subscriptions-and-payments/credits) under the Settings Page. This will automatically top up your account to a target balance when it falls below a defined threshold, ensuring your operations continue smoothly without any disruptions due to insufficient funds.

### Pricing and Credits

The price for additional minutes varies based on your subscription plan.

---

<Warning>
### Managing Your Credits

Once you exhaust your credits, your account will go through two stages:

1. **Limited Activities**: When your credits are below zero, your activities will continue, but the number of concurrent agents per activity will be reduced to one.
2. **Blocked Activities**: If your account reaches a debt of 10% of your monthly subscription price, all activities will be suspended until you recharge your credits.
</Warning>
