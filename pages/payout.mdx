# Payouts
When other companies in the NLPearl community use your Pearl in production, you earn **$0.01 for every minute of calls** handled by that Pearl.
The **Payouts** page lets you:
- Securely **connect your Stripe account**
- **Share** your Pearls with the community
- Track **remixes, likes, and earnings** over time
<Info>
  <strong>Quick overview</strong>
  1. Connect your Stripe account<br/>
  2. Create a solid, production-ready Pearl<br/>
  3. Share it with the community (name, description, cover, tags)<br/>
  4. Promote it, get users, and earn money every month

## 1. Connect your Stripe account
Before you can receive payouts, you need to connect your Stripe account.
1. Go to **Payouts** in the sidebar.
2. Click **Connect** next to _“Connect with your Stripe Account”_.
3. Complete the Stripe onboarding flow:
   - Log in or create a **Stripe account**
   - Add your **banking details**
   - Confirm your **identity** and business information
Your banking details are handled by **Stripe, not NLPearl**.
You can disconnect or update your payout settings at any time from Stripe.
<Warning>
  <strong>Important</strong><br/>
  You only get paid for usage that happens <strong>after</strong> your Stripe account is connected.
  Any calls made before that are not eligible for payouts.
</Warning>

## 2. Create a Pearl worth sharing
To earn from the community, you first need a Pearl that solves a **real** use case.
From the main dashboard:
1. Create or open a Pearl (e.g. appointment scheduling, payment collection, SaaS sales, hotel reception, etc.).
2. Make sure it:
   - Has a **clear use case** (who is it for, and what problem does it solve?)
   - Uses the **right tools and actions**
   - Is properly **integrated** (CRMs, calendars, payment links, APIs…)
   - Has **scripts or flows** that are ready for production
Once your Pearl works well in test calls, you’re ready to share it with the community.

## 3. Share your Pearl with the community
From the Pearl’s **Overview** page:
1. Click the **⋯ (more)** menu in the top-right.
2. Select **Share to Community**.
A panel opens with four key fields:
### 3.1 Public Name
This is the **public title** of your Pearl – the big text you see on the community cards.
- Keep it **short, clear, and catchy**
- Focus on **what the Pearl does**, not the full technical explanation
Examples:
- `SaaS Meeting Seller`
- `Soft Payment Collector`
- `Pizza SliceLine`
- `Dental Office Appointment`
- `Celest Hotel – Inbound Hotel`
Avoid long sentences like _“AI agent that helps you…”_ that belongs in the description, not in the title.
---
### 3.2 Description
The description is **very important**:
- It appears in your Pearl’s **detail page**
- It is used to **generate the cover image**
- It helps users instantly understand **why your Pearl is useful**
Write **2–4 short lines** that explain:
- What this Pearl does
- For which type of business
- What the main value is
Example:
> “Outbound Pearl that calls SaaS leads, qualifies them in under 3 minutes, and books meetings directly to your calendar. Perfect for B2B SaaS teams that want consistent daily demos without hiring more SDRs.”
Keep it concrete and benefit-driven.
---
### 3.3 Pearl Cover (Generate Image)
Under **Pearl Cover**, click **Generate Image**.
- The system will generate **2 images** based on your description
- If you don’t like them, you can **regenerate once** to get new options
- Pick the image that best matches the **vibe and use case** of your Pearl
You don’t have to upload anything - the image is created automatically for you.
---
### 3.4 Tags
You can add up to **4 tags** to help people discover your Pearl.
Use tags that describe:
- The **industry** (e.g. `Pizzeria`, `Hotel`, `Dental`, `SaaS`)
- The **function** (e.g. `Support`, `Sales`, `Payments`, `Bookings`)
- The **type of calls** (e.g. `Inbound`, `Outbound`)
Examples:
- `Pizzeria`, `Inbound`, `Orders`, `Delivery`
- `Hotel`, `Reservations`, `Support`
- `SaaS`, `Outbound`, `Sales`
Good tags dramatically improve search and discovery.

## 4. How payouts work
Once:
1. Your **Stripe account** is connected, and
2. Your Pearl is **shared with the community**, and
3. Other users start using your Pearl in **production**,
you earn **$0.01 per minute of calls** handled by your Pearl.
This applies whenever **other accounts** run real calls through your Pearl (not just internal tests).
<Note>
<strong>Simple formula</strong>
  <code>Your monthly earnings = Total community minutes × $0.01</code>
</Note>
### Example calculations
Assume your Pearl is being used in production by multiple businesses:
| Monthly minutes (community usage) | Your earnings |
| --------------------------------- | ------------- |
| 10,000 minutes                    | **$100**      |
| 100,000 minutes                   | **$1,000**    |
| 1,000,000 minutes                 | **$10,000**   |
Concrete scenario:
- **10 companies** each run **1,000 minutes per month** with your Pearl
- `10 × 1,000 = 10,000 minutes`
- `10,000 × $0.01 = $100 / month` for **one** Pearl
As your Pearl gets remixed and adopted by more teams, this can scale very quickly.
---
## 5. Tracking your performance
On the **Payouts** page, you’ll see:
- **Total Remixed** – how many times other users duplicated or reused your Pearl
- **Total Likes** – how many people liked your Pearl
- **Total Earned** – how much money you’ve earned so far
- A table of all **shared Pearls**, including:
  - Pearl name
  - Type (**Inbound / Outbound**)
  - Remixes
  - Likes
  - Earned
Remixes and likes don’t directly pay, but they’re strong signals that your Pearl is valuable, and they usually lead to more real usage.

## 6. Best practices to maximize payouts
To turn your Pearl into a serious revenue stream, design it so that **other people can adopt it easily**.
### 6.1 Make it remix-friendly with variables
<Tip>
  <strong>Use variables as much as possible</strong><br/>
  Variables make your Pearl flexible and easy to reuse. They let other users plug in their own company details in seconds instead of rewriting your whole script.
</Tip>
When building your Pearl:
- Use variables for things like **company name, opening hours, prices, cities, websites, booking links, support emails, etc.**
- Avoid hard-coding information that only fits **your** business (specific names, addresses, internal team names, very niche jargon)
- Keep the base script **universal**, and rely on variables + knowledge base to handle customization
Examples:
- ❌ **Bad**: "Hi, you've reached **David from NLPearl**…"
- ✅ **Good**: "Hi, you've reached **{agent_name} from {company_name}**…"
- ❌ **Bad**: "We're open from **9am to 5pm, Monday to Friday**."
- ✅ **Good**: "We're open from **{opening_hours}**."
The more you lean on variables, the easier it is for someone to remix your Pearl for their own use case, which increases your chances of earning payouts.
### 6.2 Don’t overspecify your use case
- Avoid adding too many **hyper-specific details** that will never match another user’s reality
- Focus on the **workflow** (e.g. “collect payment”, “book appointment”, “qualify lead”) instead of a single client story
- If something is unique to your own business, move it into **variables** or the **knowledge base**, not hard-coded lines
### 6.3 Test your Pearl before publishing
Before sharing your Pearl:
- Run multiple **test calls** with different scenarios
- Check that every path in the flow works and no node gets stuck
- Confirm all tools and integrations **trigger correctly**
- Listen carefully to the audio:
  - Does the voice sound **natural** and clear?
  - Are pauses and answers at the right speed?
  - Does the conversation feel like a real human interaction?
Only publish once you’d be comfortable using this Pearl in **your own production**.
### 6.4 Promote your Pearl
To boost your payouts, don’t just wait for people to find your Pearl inside NLPearl:
- Share your Pearl’s public link on **LinkedIn, X, and other social platforms**
- Show **real call examples** (with anonymized data) so people see how it behaves
- Mention that companies can **remix it in one click** and adapt it with their own variables
More visibility → more users → more minutes → higher payouts.
### 6.5 Keep improving over time
- Watch which Pearls get the most **likes, remixes, and minutes**
- Update scripts, flows, and integrations as you learn from real usage
- Consider publishing **variants** of successful Pearls for different verticals (e.g. SaaS, healthcare, hospitality)
