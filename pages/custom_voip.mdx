Custom VoIP Integration  
Learn how to integrate your own VoIP service with NLPearl.AI.

Integrate your own VoIP service with NLPearl.AI to use your existing phone numbers for inbound and outbound calls. This flexibility allows you to leverage your current VoIP infrastructure while benefiting from NLPearl.AI’s advanced features.

### How to Integrate Your Custom VoIP Service

To integrate your custom VoIP service, follow these steps:

- **Access Settings:**  
  Click on the Settings icon located at the bottom left corner of the NLPearl.AI dashboard.

- **Navigate to Phone Numbers Tab:**  
  In the Settings menu, select the Phone Numbers tab.

- **Add Phone Number:**  
  Click on the Add Phone Number button.

- **Select Custom VoIP Integration:**  
  Choose the Custom VoIP option.  

### Configuring Your Custom VoIP

In the configuration popup, you’ll need to fill in the following information:

#### 1. Phone Number

**Phone Number:** Enter the phone number you wish to integrate.  
*It can be any number – it's just for display (DID NUMBER/extension, etc.).*  

Press **Continue**.

#### Inbound Configuration Settings

- **TLS (SRTP) Encryption:**  
  Toggle On/Off: Enable this if you connect to us with TLS encryption.

- **Authentication Methods (choose one):**

  - **IP Address Authentication:**  
    **IP Address:** Enter the IP addresses of your VoIP servers so we can authorize requests from them.

  - **Credentials Authentication (Optional):**  
    This is the username and password you need to send when making a request.  
    **Username:** Username for authentication (minimum X and maximum X).  
    **Password:** Password (minimum X characters, 1 digit, mix, etc.).

*Once you save the inbound configuration, you will receive a SIP Domain to connect. You will need to add this SIP Domain to your VoIP configuration so it can transfer the call to our platform. If you choose Credentials Authentication, make sure to also include the username and password you select in your VoIP settings.*


#### Outbound Configuration Settings

- **TLS (SRTP) Encryption:**  
  Toggle On/Off: Enable this if your VoIP service requires TLS encryption.

- **SIP Trunk URL:**  
  **URL:** Enter the SIP trunk URL provided by your VoIP provider.

- **User Part:**  
  **E.164 Number/Extension/User ID:** Enter the identifier used for outbound calls (e.g., your phone number in E.164 format, extension, or user ID).

- **Authentication Methods (optional based on your VoIP):**

  - **Credentials Authentication:**  
    **Username:** Enter your SIP username.  
    **Password:** Enter your SIP password.

  - **Header-Based Authentication:**  
    **Header Key:** Enter the header key required for authentication.  
    **Header Value:** Enter the corresponding header value.

  - **IP Address Allow List:**  
    **IP Address:** See [Twilio's SIP Trunking IP Addresses](https://www.twilio.com/docs/sip-trunking/ip-addresses).
