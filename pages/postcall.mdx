## üìò What is a Post-Call?  
In NLPearl, a **post-call** is a structured summary generated after each phone conversation handled by Pearl. It centralizes all key information captured before, during, and after the call to ensure full traceability, improve quality, and support human follow‚Äëup when needed.

## üìù What Does the Post-Call Include?

A post-call provides multiple key sections to review and analyze the outcome of a conversation:

### Call Details  
This section shows essential information about the call itself, including:
- **Call Duration**: Total time of the call.
- **Date & Time**: When the call took place.
- **Call Status**: The technical status of the call (whether the user answered or not). Possible values include:
  - `In Progress`
  - `Completed`
  - `Busy`
  - `Failed`
  - `No Answer`

  <Info>Call Status refers to the telephony-level result of the call connection, such as whether the call was picked up, missed, busy, or failed to connect.</Info>

- **Conversation Status**: Indicates the outcome of the conversation from a business or process perspective. Possible values include:
  - `Voice Mail Left` (only visible for **outbound activities**)
  - `Need Retry` (only visible for **outbound activities**)
  - `Unreachable` (only visible for **outbound activities**)
  - `Call Successful`
  - `Not Successful`
  - `Completed`

üëâ **Important distinctions about Conversation Status**:

- `Voice Mail Left`, `Need Retry`, and `Unreachable` are **only shown for outbound activities**; these statuses are not applicable for inbound calls.
  
- The difference between `Successful`, `Not Successful`, and `Complete` depends on whether a **Success Definition** was configured when creating the Pearl:
  - If a **Success Definition** was configured:
    - `Successful` ‚Üí the Success Definition criteria were met during the conversation.
    - `Not Successful` ‚Üí the conversation did not meet the Success Definition criteria.
  - If **no Success Definition** was configured:
    - `Complete` ‚Üí the conversation was completed without any Success Definition evaluation.

üëâ For more information on Success Definitions, see [How to Create a Pearl ‚Äì Step 4: Flow Configuration](/pages/create_pearl#step-4-flow-configuration).

- **Tags**:  
  The list of **tags defined during the last step of the Pearl creation process**. These tags represent key topics or categories you chose when setting up the Pearl configuration.  
  üëâ For more information on setting up tags, see [How to Create a Pearl ‚Äì Step 4: Flow Configuration](/pages/create_pearl#step-4-flow-configuration).

- **Events**:  
  A log of the actions triggered by Pearl during the call. Each event includes a timestamp and details about the action.  
  Possible event types include:
  - `Call Transferred`: The call was transferred.
  - `SMS Sent`: A text message was sent to the customer.
  - `API`: An API was triggered during the conversation.
  - `Email Sent`: An email was sent during the call.
  - `Appointment Booked`: An appointment was booked in the calendar.

Each event includes a timestamp and details about the action.

- **Sentiment Analysis**:  
  An automatic classification of the customer's tone and emotional state throughout the conversation. Possible sentiment values include:
  - `Positive`
  - `Slightly Positive`
  - `Neutral`
  - `Slightly Negative`
  - `Negative`
