## What is a Post-Call?  
In NLPearl, a **post-call** is a structured summary generated after each phone conversation handled by Pearl. It centralizes all key information captured before, during, and after the call to ensure full traceability, improve quality, and support human follow‑up when needed.

---

## What Does the Post-Call Include?

A post-call provides multiple key sections to review and analyze the outcome of a conversation:

### Call ID
 A unique identifier for each call, displayed at the top right of the page. It allows you to quickly reference or search for a specific call across the system.

### Call Details  

This section summarizes the essential metadata captured during the call, including participant details, call status, timing, and performance metrics.

|---------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `In Progress` | The call is currently ongoing or being connected.                          |
| `Completed`   | The call was successfully connected and ended normally.                    |
| `Busy`        | The receiver was already on another call or rejected the call.             |
| `Failed`      | The call could not be established due to an error or network issue.        |
| `No Answer`   | The call rang but no one picked up before the timeout.                     |

<Info>Call Status refers to the telephony-level result of the call connection, such as whether the call was picked up, missed, busy, or failed to connect.</Info>

**Conversation Status** <br />
Indicates the outcome of the conversation from a business or process perspective. Possible values include:

| Status               | Description                                                            |
|----------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `Voice Mail Left`    | A voicemail was successfully left. *(Outbound only)*                  |
| `Need Retry`         | The contact attempt failed and should be retried. *(Outbound only)*   |
| `Unreachable`        | The user could not be reached. *(Outbound only)*                      |
| `Call Successful`    | The conversation achieved its expected outcome.                       |

| `Completed`          | The conversation was conducted and finalized, regardless of outcome.  |

<Card icon="circle-info" iconType="light">
  <b>Important distinctions about Conversation Status</b>:

  - `Voice Mail Left`, `Need Retry`, and `Unreachable` are **only shown for outbound activities**; these statuses are not applicable for inbound calls.
  
  - The difference between `Successful`, `Not Successful`, and `Complete` depends on whether a **Success Definition** was configured when creating the Pearl:
    - If a **Success Definition** was configured:
      - `Successful` → the Success Definition criteria were met during the conversation.
      - `Not Successful` → the conversation did not meet the Success Definition criteria.
    - If **no Success Definition** was configured:
      - `Complete` → the conversation was completed without any Success Definition evaluation.

<Warning>If you wish to **disable call recording**, you can manage this setting from the activity configuration (whether **inbound** or **outbound**).</Warning>
👉 For more information on recording settings, see [Inbound Recording](/pages/inbound) or [Outbound Recording](/pages/outbound).

If you're unable to listen to your recording and you imported a phone number from your Twilio account by connecting it to the platform, it is possible that you cannot access the recording because you have not disabled the 'HTTP Basic Authentication' option in your Twilio settings. For more information see [Disable HTTP Auth from Twilio](/pages/twilio_integration#disabling-http-basic-authentication-for-media-access)
