## What is a Post-Call?  
In NLPearl, a **post-call** is a structured summary generated after each phone conversation handled by Pearl. It centralizes all key information captured before, during, and after the call to ensure full traceability, improve quality, and support human follow‚Äëup when needed.

---

## What Does the Post-Call Include?

A post-call provides multiple key sections to review and analyze the outcome of a conversation:

### Call ID
 A unique identifier for each call, displayed at the top right of the page. It allows you to quickly reference or search for a specific call across the system.

**Call Status** <br />
The technical status of the call (whether the user answered or not). Possible values include:

  - `In Progress` 
  - `Completed` 
  - `Busy` 
  - `Failed`
  - `No Answer`

  <Info>Call Status refers to the telephony-level result of the call connection, such as whether the call was picked up, missed, busy, or failed to connect.</Info>

---

**Conversation Status** <br />
Indicates the outcome of the conversation from a business or process perspective. Possible values include:

  - `Voice Mail Left` (only visible for outbound activities)
  - `Need Retry` (only visible for outbound activities)
  - `Unreachable` (only visible for outbound activities)
  - `Call Successful`
  - `Not Successful`
  - `Completed`

<Card icon="circle-info" iconType="light">
  <b>Important distinctions about Conversation Status</b>:

  - `Voice Mail Left`, `Need Retry`, and `Unreachable` are **only shown for outbound activities**; these statuses are not applicable for inbound calls.
  
  - The difference between `Successful`, `Not Successful`, and `Complete` depends on whether a **Success Definition** was configured when creating the Pearl:
    - If a **Success Definition** was configured:
      - `Successful` ‚Üí the Success Definition criteria were met during the conversation.
      - `Not Successful` ‚Üí the conversation did not meet the Success Definition criteria.
    - If **no Success Definition** was configured:
      - `Complete` ‚Üí the conversation was completed without any Success Definition evaluation.
</Card>


<Note> For more information on Success Definitions, see [How to Create a Pearl ‚Äì Step 4: Flow Configuration](/pages/create_pearl#step-4-flow-configuration).</Note>

---

**Tags** <br />
  The list of **tags defined during the last step of the Pearl creation process**. These tags represent key topics or categories you chose when setting up the Pearl configuration.

<Warning>If you wish to **disable call recording**, you can manage this setting from the activity configuration (whether **inbound** or **outbound**).</Warning>
üëâ For more information on recording settings, see [Inbound Recording](/pages/inbound) or [Outbound Recording](/pages/outbound).

If you're unable to listen to your recording and you imported a phone number from your Twilio account by connecting it to the platform, it is possible that you cannot access the recording because you have 
not disabled the 'HTTP Basic Authentication' option in your Twilio settings. For more information see [Disable HTTP Auth from Twilio](/pages/twilio_integration#disabling-http-basic-authentication-for-media-access)
