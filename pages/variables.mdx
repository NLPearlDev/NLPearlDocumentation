## Introduction

Variables are essential placeholders that store and manipulate data during a conversation. They hold information such as:

- **User Inputs**: Data collected from user responses (e.g., names, email addresses).
- **System Data**: Information retrieved from external sources like CRM systems.
- **Computed Values**: Results from expressions or calculations within the conversation flow.

### Why Are Variables Important?

- **Personalize Interactions**: Tailor conversations to individual users for a more engaging experience.
- **Control Conversation Flow**: Make decisions and branch dialogues based on variable values.
- **Store and Reuse Information**: Keep track of data throughout the conversation for consistency.
- **Integrate with External Systems**: Enrich conversations with data from other platforms.
- **Enhance Actions**: Use variables in actions like sending personalized emails or SMS messages.

## Accessing the Variable Manager

Variables can be managed using the **Variable Manager**, which is accessible in both **Simple Mode** and **Advanced Mode (Tree Editor)**.

### Variable Manager Overview

The Variable Manager allows you to create, edit, and organize variables used in your conversation flows. Variables are categorized into two types:

- **Pre-call Variables**: Variables configured before the call starts, such as customer information.
These variables are typically sourced from external systems like CRM or imported via CSV or API. They provide context and initial data that can be used throughout the conversation.
- **Collected In-call Variables**: Variables captured or updated dynamically during the conversation.
These variables are collected based on user interactions, inputs, or system computations, allowing the conversation to adapt in real-time and respond to user needs effectively.

#### Accessing the Variable Manager

1. **In Simple Mode**:
   - Navigate to the **Flow Configuration** page.
   - Click on the **"+"** icon to open the Variable Manager.

2. **In Advanced Mode (Tree Editor)**:
   - Within the nodes on the **Tree Editor** page, click the **"+"** icon inside a node to open the Variable Manager.
   - Alternatively, you can press the document icon on the bottom right side of the editor to open the Variable Manager.

#### Variable Categories

- **Pre-call Variables**: Represented with a **person icon**.

## Using Variables in Conversations

### Collecting User Input into Variables

- **In Simple Mode**: Simply add a variable to the question step; this will automatically store the user's response into that variable.
- **In Advanced Mode**: In the node's configuration, locate the **"Store In Variable"** field.


### Inserting Variables into Agent Scripts

1. **Compose the Agent's Script** in any text field within your flow.
2. **Insert Variable Placeholder**:
   - Click the **"+"** icon next to the text field.
   - Select the desired variable from the list.

**Example**:

- **Script**: "Thank you for calling, `customerName`!"

### Using Variables in Actions

1. **Add an Action Node** (e.g., **Email Node**, **SMS Node**) to your flow.
2. **Configure the Action**:
   - **Message Content**: Include variables by clicking the **"+"** icon and selecting the desired variable.
3. **Customize the Message** with variable placeholders.

**Example in SMS Node**:

- **Message Content**: "Hello `customerName`, your appointment on `appointmentDate` is confirmed."

## Implementing Conditional Logic with Variables

### Conditional Branching

1. **Enable Conditional Transitions** in a node's configuration by toggling the **"Conditional Branching"** option.


2. **Add Conditions** using variables and operators (e.g., **`satisfactionScore >= 4`**).


3. **Label Each Condition** for clarity.


4. **Connect to Subsequent Nodes** based on each condition.

**Example**:

- **Variable**: `satisfactionScore`
- **Conditions**:
  - If **`satisfactionScore >= 4`**, proceed to positive feedback node.
  - If **`satisfactionScore < 4`**, proceed to improvement inquiry node.

## Populating Variables from External Data

### Adding Variables via the Platform (Outbound Campaigns)

1. **Navigate to Outbound Campaigns** in the platform.
2. **Download the Lead Template CSV**, which includes columns for your variables.


3. **Fill in Lead Data** in the CSV file, ensuring each variable corresponds to the correct column.
4. **Upload the Completed CSV** back to the platform.


**Example CSV Entry**:

| phoneNumber | customerName | membershipStatus |
|-------------|--------------|------------------|
| +1234567890 | Jane Smith   | Gold             |

### Adding Variables via API

1. **Use the Add Lead API Endpoint**: `PUT /v1/Outbound/{outboundId}/Lead`.
2. **Include Variables** in the `callData` field of your JSON payload.

**Example Request**:

```http
PUT /v1/Outbound/{outboundId}/Lead
Content-Type: application/json
Authorization: Bearer <token>

{
  "phoneNumber": "+1234567890",
  "externalId": "lead123",
  "callData": {
    "customerName": "Jane Smith",
    "membershipStatus": "Gold"
  }
}
```

### Sending Variables in Single On-Demand Calls

1. **Use the Make Call API Endpoint**: `POST /v1/Outbound/{outboundId}/Call`.
2. **Include Variables** in the `callData` field of your JSON payload.

**Example Request**:

```http
POST /v1/Outbound/{outboundId}/Call
Content-Type: application/json
Authorization: Bearer <token>

{
  "to": "+1234567890",
  "callData": {
    "firstName": "John",
    "accountBalance": "$100"
  }
}
```

## Best Practices for Using Variables

- **Use Descriptive Names**: Clearly name variables for easy identification (e.g., `customerEmail`).
- **Define Variables Early**: Plan your variables before building the conversation flow.
- **Categorize Variables**: Use **Pre-call** and **Collected In-call** categories to organize your variables.
- **Avoid Unnecessary Variables**: Only create variables that are essential to your conversation.
- **Test Thoroughly**: Simulate conversations to ensure variables function as intended.
- **Handle Data Securely**: Be cautious with personal and sensitive information.
- **Document Variables**: Use the description field to note the purpose of each variable.
- **Use Allowed Values and Codes**: When appropriate, define allowed values and use codes for better data management.

## Examples

### Example 1: Personalizing an Outbound Call

**Scenario**: Notifying customers about a service upgrade.

1. **Variables**:
   - **Pre-call Variables**:
     - `customerName` (Text)
     - `currentPlan` (Text)
   - **Collected In-call Variables**:
     - `interested` (Boolean)
2. **Script**: "Hello **{customerName}**, we're excited to inform you about an upgrade to your **{currentPlan}** plan."
3. **Collect Interest**:
   - Question: "Would you like to hear more about this upgrade?"
   - Store response in `interested` (Boolean).
4. **Implement Conditional Logic**:
   - If **`interested`** is **true**, proceed with details.
   - If **false**, thank the customer and end the call.
5. **Adding Leads via CSV**: Use the platform to import leads with the `customerName` and `currentPlan` variables populated.

### Example 2: Scheduling Multiple Dates

**Scenario**: Collecting multiple available dates from a customer.

1. **Variable**:
   - `availableDates` (Date & Time)
   - **Allow Multiple Entries**: Enabled.
2. **Script**: "Please provide the dates you are available for the meeting."
3. **Collect Dates**:
   - The system allows the customer to provide multiple dates, which are stored in the `availableDates` variable.
4. **Usage**:
   - The collected dates can be used to schedule meetings or appointments.

### Example 3: Dynamic Survey with Conditional Logic

**Scenario**: Gathering customer feedback.

1. **Ask Satisfaction Score**:
   - Question: "On a scale of 1 to 5, how satisfied are you with our service?"
   - Store in `satisfactionScore` (Whole Number).
2. **Conditional Paths**:
   - If **`satisfactionScore >= 4`**, proceed to a node thanking the customer.
   - If **`satisfactionScore < 4`**, proceed to a node asking for improvement suggestions.
3. **Follow-Up Actions**: Send a personalized email using collected data, thanking them or addressing concerns.
