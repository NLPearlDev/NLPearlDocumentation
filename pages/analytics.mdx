## 📊 Call Analytics in NLPearl

NLPearl provides detailed analytics for every campaign, helping you track performance, understand Pearl's activity, and optimize your strategy in real time.

<Callout type="info" title="How this dashboard works">
Outbound campaigns (initiated by Pearl) offer more data, while inbound campaigns show a lighter set of insights. All data reflects Pearl’s automated voice interactions — not human agents.
</Callout>

### 🧭 Key Metrics Overview

- **Total Calls**: Number of call attempts made during the selected period.
- **Completed**: Calls where someone picked up and interacted with Pearl, regardless of outcome.
- **Successful**: Calls that achieved the success condition defined for the Pearl (e.g. booking, confirmation, etc).
- **Unsuccessful**: The conversation happened, but the user declined or failed to reach the intended outcome.
- **Need Retry**: The lead picked up, but the conversation was interrupted or incomplete. These are flagged for retry.
- **Voice Mail Left**: Pearl left a voicemail.
- **Unreachable**: No one picked up or the number was unreachable.

---

### ⏱️ Average Call Duration

This graph shows the **average duration of calls from the moment the person picks up or starts interacting with Pearl**. Useful to:

- Detect drop-offs
- Monitor engagement quality
- Measure attention span

---

### ✅ Success Rate

This shows the **percentage of calls that achieved the goal you defined when creating your Pearl** — like booking a meeting, confirming information, or anything else you set as a success.

<Callout type="tip">
Combine success rate with call duration to get insights into how efficient your conversations are.
</Callout>

### 🔁 Events Triggered

See **all the actions triggered by Pearl during conversations** — and how many times each one occurred. For example:

- **Call Transferred**
- **SMS Sent**
- **Message Taken**
- **Calendar Booked**
- **Email Sent**

These help you understand how much your agent is actually doing during calls.

---

### 🏷️ Tag Frequency

These are the **custom tags you defined when creating your Pearl**. They help you track key topics, intents, or outcomes during calls — like `"No"`, `"Transfer"`, or `"Link"`.

<Callout type="info">
Tags are applied automatically based on what the user says or how the conversation flows.
</Callout>
